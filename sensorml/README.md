# Sensor Model Language (SensorML)


The primary focus of the Sensor Model Language (SensorML) is to provide a robust and semantically-tied means of defining processes and processing components associated with the measurement and post-measurement transformation of observations. This includes sensors and actuators as well as computational processes applied pre- and postmeasurement. The main objective is to enable interoperability, first at the syntactic level and later at the semantic level (by using ontologies and semantic mediation), so that sensors and processes can be better understood by machines, utilized automatically in complex workflows, and easily shared between intelligent sensor web nodes. This standard is one of several implementation standards produced under OGCâ€™s Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) activity. This standard is a revision of content that was previously integrated in the SensorML version 1.0 standard (OGC 07-000).
