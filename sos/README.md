The SOS standard is applicable to use cases in which sensor data needs to be managed in an interoperable way. This standard defines a Web service interface which allows querying observations, sensor metadata, as well as representations of observed features. Further, this standard defines means to register new sensors and to remove existing ones. Also, it defines operations to insert new sensor observations. This standard defines this functionality in a binding independent way; two bindings are specified in this document: a KVP binding and a SOAP binding.
