# SWE Common Data Model Encoding Standard


The Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) Common Data Model Encoding Standard defines low level data models for exchanging sensor related data between nodes of the OGCÂ® Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) framework. These models allow applications and/or servers to structure, encode and transmit sensor datasets in a self describing and semantically enabled way.

SWE Common 1.0 was defined in the OGC SensorML 1.0 Standard available at http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/sensorml.
