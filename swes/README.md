# SWE Service Model Implementation Standard


This standard currently defines eight packages with data types for common use across OGC Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) services. Five of these packages define operation request and response types. The packages are: 1.) Contents – Defines data types that can be used in specific services that provide (access to) sensors; 2.) Notification – Defines the data types that support provision of metadata about the notification capabilities of a service as well as the definition and encoding of SWES events; 3.) Common - Defines data types common to other packages; 4.) Common Codes –Defines commonly used lists of codes with special semantics; 5.) DescribeSensor – Defines the request and response types of an operation used to retrieve metadata about a given sensor; 6.) UpdateSensorDescription –Defines the request and response types of an operation used to modify the description of a given sensor; 7.) InsertSensor – Defines the request and response types of an operation used to insert a new sensor instance at a service; 8.) DeleteSensor – Defines the request and response types of an operation used to remove a sensor from a service. These packages use data types specified in other standards. Those data types are normatively referenced herein, instead of being repeated in this standard.
